## Product direction

Ashar's vision: Wordle Royale should be for Wordle what chess.com / lichess are for chess — competitive, social, ranked, replayable, multi-page, and rating-driven with Elo/MMR as a core loop.

## Visual/product correction

UI should stay human, calm, functional, minimal, game-first, rating/community oriented — closer to lichess than a glossy AI/SaaS dashboard. Continue adding real product depth, not decorative pages.

## Completed checkpoint

Tickets 01–88 are complete through Wave L. PR #2 merged to `main` and GitHub Actions passed on the merge commit.

## Wave M — Preview deploy-shape and checkpoint unblock

| Ticket | Agent | Title | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 88 | Yuna | Wave L PR/CI Unblock and Remote Checkpoint | Complete; PR #2 merged and post-merge CI passed |
| 89 | Elisa | Preview MVP Account/Session Decision Lock | Complete; explicit preview demo-session recommended |

## Recommended order

1. M.0 first: Ticket 88, and Ticket 89 in parallel if available.
2. M.1: Ticket 90, then Ticket 91 after Ticket 90 exposes a deploy-shape smoke command.
3. M.2: Ticket 92 only after Ticket 89; Ticket 93 after Ticket 89/92; Ticket 94 can run in parallel if phone observation is available.
4. M.3: Ticket 95 checkpoint PR/CI.
5. M.4: Ticket 96 QA last.

## Persistent constraints

- Prefer free/open-source/local-first tooling.
- Do not add paid SaaS, paid cloud resources, proprietary datasets, or subscription dependencies without Ashar approval.
- Do not commit secrets or create real `.env` files.
- Do not deploy, create external services, or configure production secrets without explicit Ashar approval.
- Preserve spoiler safety and server authority for gameplay/rating logic.
- Use branch + PR + GitHub Actions for checkpoints.
